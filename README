Logitech Revue Hacks
by Dan Rosenberg (@djrbliss)
=============================

This project includes three components:


1. nandpwn

A local privilege escalation exploit for the Logitech Revue that leverages the
ability to map the hardware registers of the NAND flash controller in
conjunction with a Linux kernel information leak to clobber kernel memory in a
way that allows gaining privileges.

This exploit is highly unstable. Although it has never caused any permanent
damage in testing, I take no responsibility if this turns your device into a
brick. In addition, it is known to only succeed a fraction of the time, so you
will probably have to try it repeatedly, and some of those attempts may cause
your device to freeze (which can be solved by a reboot).


2. codesign

Once you have root, this can be run to disable code signing enforcement so
custom kernel modules can be run. No known issues were observed during testing.


3. blockwrite

Remaps a specified block device as writable at both the MTD and block layers,
to allow flashing a replacement. No known issues were observed during testing.
